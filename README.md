## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

Using six metrics from various datasets over numerous time stamps, we were able to calculate a metric: the Environmental Impact Score. This metric assess the susceptibility/impact on a region's environment. The six metrics were water quality, pollution, albedo, deforestation, ozone, soil quality. This further identifies metrics in which the region can improve, as well as suggestions for solutions that may help. Finally, registered users are able to communicate with other users to collaborate in implementing these solutions for the region.

## PROJECT DETAILS

Our project uses satellite data to gather 6 primary metrics as described in the summary and computes an Environmental Impact Score for your selected region. It then offers solutions for bettering the score of your region and facilitates communications and collaboration with others in your area to collectively improve your homes/cities and communities. To create this we used react.js for the front end alongside HTML, CSS, and JS. For the backend we used flask, python, and firebase for data storage and usage. We hosted our demo using google cloud.
